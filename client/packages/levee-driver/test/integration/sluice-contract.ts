/**
 * Sluice service contract — the acceptance boundary a standalone Sluice
 * server must satisfy for an unmodified `@fluidframework/routerlicious-driver`
 * to work against it.
 *
 * This module is the executable baseline for the Sluice migration: later
 * tasks that port runtime behaviour from Phoenix/Levee to the Gleam Sluice
 * service are expected to keep `sluice-routerlicious.test.ts` (and any new
 * conformance suites) green against this contract rather than growing a new,
 * parallel definition of "what Sluice supports".
 *
 * Sluice is the destination service; Phoenix/Levee
 * (`server/lib/levee_web/socket_io_websock.ex`, `server/lib/levee_web/router.ex`)
 * is temporary migration scaffolding and must not be treated as the source of
 * truth once Sluice implements a given endpoint or event.
 *
 * Event names below mirror the dewdrop package's Socket.IO event definitions
 * (https://github.com/tylerbutler/dewdrop/blob/main/src/dewdrop/events.gleam)
 * verbatim — that Gleam module is the single source of truth for the Socket.IO
 * event vocabulary shared by dewdrop/beryl/spillway. If the two ever drift,
 * treat the upstream `events.gleam` as authoritative and fix this file, not the reverse.
